        <description lang="en_GB">This Dilbert plugin gives access to the daily Dilbert comic strip, random Dilbert comic strips, recent comic strips or comic strip by date input. Additionally you can browse all strips available by date. Thanks to the creator of the Dilbert Plugin and Garfield Comic Plugin, which I took as basis for this plugin as the original Plugin didn't work anymore for me.</description>
